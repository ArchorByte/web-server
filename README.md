# Web server
Deploy a website using this **socket** and **web server** made in C++ from scratch! <br/>
To easily handle back-end with this web server, you have a new custom tag at your disposal for your HTML pages.

# ⚒️ Custom tag
To build the back-end of your website in C++, this project offers you a new tag to directly use in your HTML pages: **`<++  ++>`**. To use it, you put the tag in your page, and give it a name. For instance, let's say I want to name this tag "*test*", I write this into the HTML page: **`<++ test ++>`**. Once it's done, in the function that you associated to a specific route, to replace this tag with actual data, you define a vector list to add `BackendData` objects to it, and use the helper functions to do the modifications for you. Let's imagine I want to replace my test tag with the message "*Hello World!*":
``` c++
const std::vector<BackendData> backend_data
{
    { "test", "Hello World!" },
};

std::vector<std::string> html_page = Utils::Files::read_file("./website/page.html");
const std::string rendering = Routes::replace_custom_tags(backend_data, html_page);
```

# ⚙️ Configuration
You can configure the web server using the `./config/socket.config` file. <br/>
The default configuration is available at the bottom of this section. <br/>
Here are the different options you have: <br/>
- `"ADDRESS"` -> Address to deploy the server to.
- `"PORT"` -> Port to listen on the specified address.
- `"MAX_RETRIES"` -> Amount of time the socket server tries to listen the port before aborting.
``` config
ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
PORT=8080
MAX_RETRIES=5
```
